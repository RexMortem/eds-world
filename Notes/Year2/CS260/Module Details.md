# Module Overview

- Analysis of Algorithms 
	- Asymptotic Analysis (big O notation, $\Theta$, $\Omega$ from cs126 or similar)
	- Recursive Analysis
- Many different algorithms! 
	- Algorithms for different kinds of data (graphs, numeric etc.)
	- Algorithms of different paradigms (greedy, divide and conquer, DP etc.)
- Computational complexity (and what algorithms can't do)

## The Paradigms & Problems 

- Greedy algorithms: making locally maximising (or minimising) choices 
- Graph algorithms: shortest path, spanning trees
- Divide and Conquer: breaking a big problem into smaller problems (and solving them)
- Dynamic Programming: breaking a big problem into *overlapping* smaller problems 
- f
- P vs NP
- NP-completeness, mutual reducibility 
- Graph algorithms 2
- Flow networks
