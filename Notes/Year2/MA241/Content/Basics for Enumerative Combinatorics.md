## Number of ways to arrange n objects 

Imagine first choosing which object will be at the start of the sequence. There will be $n$ choices. 

After choosing the first, there are $n-1$ choices remaining for the second object. 

The choices for each object become: $n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times (n-3) \times \dots \times 2 \times 1$.

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange n objects is $n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \dots \times 2 \times 1$.

So the number of ways to arrange n object is $n!$.
