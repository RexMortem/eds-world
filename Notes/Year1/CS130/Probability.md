# Probability 

**Scenario:** Imagine that you roll a D10 dice. 

A ***sample space*** ($\Omega$) is the set of all possible outcomes. 
For this dice, $\Omega = \{1, 2, \dots , 10\}$.

An ***event*** is a subset of the sample space.
For this dice, events include: 
- $E = \{3\}$ (rolling a 3)
- $E = \{8, 9, 10\}$ (rolling greater than 7)
- $E = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$ (rolling an even number)

We call events $A, B$ ***disjoint*** iff $A \cap B = \emptyset$.
In other words, "A and B are disjoint if you can't have both".
For example, $A = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}$ and $B = \{4, 6, 8\}$ are disjoint events. 

The ***complement*** of an event $A$ is everything *else* in the set.
That is, $\bar{A} = \Omega \setminus A$.
For example, if $E = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$ then $\bar{E} = \{1,3,5,7,9\}$.
A universal example, $\bar{\Omega} = \emptyset$
