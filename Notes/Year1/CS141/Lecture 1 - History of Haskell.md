<h2> Theorem 1: Church-Turing Thesis <h2>

*"Any algorithm that can be expressed using a turing machine can be expressed in lambda calculus AND any algorithm that can be expressed in lambda calculus can be expressed using a turing machine"*

Basically, they're equivalently powerful but they achieve the same algorithm through different means. 

<h2> Definitions </h2>

- A programming paradigm is a name given to a set of languages that share a programming style, way of evaluation, and toolset available. 

- A pure function is one whose output relies solely on its inputs. It does not rely on global state or mutate global state (side effects are mutating).

<h2> Haskell as a language </h2>

Haskell is a lazily evaluated and purely functional programming language.
